## Tile Implementation {#sec:tiles-impl}

In @sec:tiles, we specified the algebra for an image tiling algebra. As a quick
refresher, our algebra allows us to build images by subdividing space into
"tiles," which can be rotated and flipped. Our public interface eventually ended
up looking like this:

```haskell
data Tile a
instance Functor Tile
instance Applicative Tile

rasterize :: Int -> Int -> Tile a -> [[a]]

cw    :: Tile a -> Tile a
ccw   :: Tile a -> Tile a
flipH :: Tile a -> Tile a
flipV :: Tile a -> Tile a

quad  :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
swirl :: Tile a -> Tile a

beside :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
above  :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a

empty  :: Monoid a => Tile a
behind :: Monoid a => Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
```

We are left now with the task of *actually implementing* this thing. Unfortunately, computers are unable to execute our specifications directly, so
we must translate our design into code. Our path for getting there will be
incremental, done in three distinct phases. First, we will implement a solution
that is naive but obviously-correct. Second, we will use the naive
implementation to generate a broad suite of regression tests automatically.
Finally, we will give an innovative, optimized implementation, using our new test
suite to ensure we haven't introduced any bugs along the way.


### The Initial Encoding

By construction, every algebra gives rise to an "obvious"
implementation called its *initial encoding.* You might be familiar with initial
encodings under the object-oriented concept "interpreter pattern."  If not, the
initial encoding is a fancy name for implementing each of our algebra's
constructors as a *data constructor directly in the implementation language*.

The idea is this: we will build an explicit data structure representing our
tile. Later, when we go to "interpret" it --- that is, `rasterize` it --- the
drawing routines can traverse this tree, doing different drawing operations for
every different sort of node.  An initial encoding is characterized by creating
a tree of data whose nodes correspond precisely with the
algebraic constructors. For this reason, we might refer to "trees" and "nodes" in the following
section, but these refer only to terms and constructors, respectively.

To illustrate the initial encoding, one of the infinitely many ways of
implementing `Tile` is as follows:

```haskell
data Tile a where
  Cw    :: Tile a -> Tile a
  Ccw   :: Tile a -> Tile a
  FlipH :: Tile a -> Tile a
  FlipV :: Tile a -> Tile a
  Quad  :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
  Swirl :: Tile a -> Tile a
  Beside :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
  Above  :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
  Empty  :: Monoid a => Tile a
  Behind :: Monoid a => Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
  Fmap :: (a -> b) -> Tile a -> Tile b  -- ! 1
  Pure :: a -> Tile a  -- ! 2
  Ap   :: Tile (a -> b) -> Tile a -> Tile b  -- ! 3
```

The constructors marked by [1](Ann), [2](Ann) and [3](Ann) correspond
respectively to the (implicit) ways of building tiles via `fmap`, `pure`, and
`(<*>)`.

You might be wondering why `rasterize` doesn't appear here. It doesn't, by virtue
of not being a constructor. It's an observation over our algebra. Rasterizing is
our only way to get data out of the system; it cannot help us get
information in.

With the definition of `Tile` in place, we can give a trivial implementation for
every constructor in our algebra:

```haskell
cw :: Tile a -> Tile a
cw = Cw

ccw :: Tile a -> Tile a
ccw = Ccw

flipH :: Tile a -> Tile a
flipH = FlipH

-- etc
```

By giving a Haskell constructor for every constructor in our algebra, we can
build a one-to-one mapping between the terms in our algebra and a "syntax tree"
for our algebra in Haskell. There is absolutely no computational power here; all
we have managed to compute is a tree in memory that corresponds precisely with a
term in our algebra. We can now imagine implementing the `rasterize` observation
by pattern matching on this tree --- doing the "right thing" in each case.

But this one-to-one mapping is not the whole story; it doesn't necessarily
satisfy the laws that it is supposed to. For example, `law:flipH/flipH` states
that `flipH . flipH = id`, but this is decidedly not true given the
definition of `flipH` above. We can force the laws to hold by fiat, simply by
performing some pattern matching in the definition of `flipH`:

```haskell
flipH :: Tile a -> Tile a
flipH (FlipH t) = t  -- ! 1
flipH t = FlipH t  -- ! 2
```

This new definition, at [1](Ann), checks a term to see if its root is already
a `FlipH` node, and if so, removes it --- satisfying the law that `flipH . flipH
= id`. If this is *not* the case, as in [2](Ann), we instead *add* a `FlipH`
node. As another example, we expect that `cw . cw . cw . cw = id`, and can
encode it as follows:

```haskell
cw :: Tile a -> Tile a
cw (Cw (Cw (Cw t))) = t  -- ! 1
cw t = Cw t
```

Because it's non-obvious, we should note that it's vital that there are only
three `Cw` data constructors at [1](Ann). The fourth comes from the
definition of `cw` itself.

You can imagine how a patient and assiduous implementer could go through
every equation in our algebra and write them, one by one, as pattern matches.
Such an approach would certainly ensure that every law holds, but it quickly
becomes an untenable amount of work for even moderately-sized algebras.

Instead of doing all this work by hand, we can employ our equations themselves
to simplify the task. The high-level idea here is that we can pick a core set of
"primitive" operations in our algebra, and use our laws to rewrite every other
combinator in terms of the primitives. Instead of the massive
thirteen-constructor definition of `Tile` above, we can distill it down into
only these five:

```haskell
data Tile a where
  Cw     :: Tile a -> Tile a
  FlipH  :: Tile a -> Tile a
  Above  :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
  Pure   :: a -> Tile a
  Ap     :: Tile (a -> b) -> Tile a -> Tile b
```

Where did these five come from, you might wonder. The answer is that they come
from trial and error, and I have saved my readers from the trial on this
particular example. Picking primitives is more of an art than a science; we can
allow our intuition and implementation experience to suggest constructors to use as
primitives. There is little consequence for picking a lousy set of primitives; if
it's not minimal, you'll have to do a bit more work. If it's insufficient to
implement the entire algebra, you'll get stuck within five minutes and can then
backtrack.

In the case of `Tile` above, our primitive data constructors correspond
with constructors in our algebra, but this is not a requirement. We
will look at an example of a drastically different representation in
@sec:scavenge-impl.

We still should give the pattern matching by-fiat laws when implementing the
algebra's constructors in terms of these data constructors. But by having fewer
syntactical forms in the mix, we have fewer combinations of laws we need to enforce manually. Let's first give the remaining primitive implementations:
```haskell
above :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
above = Above

instance Applicative Tile where
  pure = Pure
  (<*>) = Ap
```


The trick is now to find derivations of the other, non-primitive constructors in
terms of these primitives. To illustrate this, we'd like to find a derivation of
`ccw`:

```{.haskell .proof}
  ccw t
= -- .via cw/cw/cw/cw
  ccw (cw (cw (cw (cw t))))
= -- .via ccw/cw
  cw (cw (cw t)))
```

Since we have the implicit primitive law that `Cw = cw`, we have derived an
implementation of `ccw` in terms of our primitives. We choose to use `cw` here
rather than the data constructor `Cw` directly because `cw` performs the
automatic simplification of `law:cw/cw/cw/cw`. This derivation maps directly to
an implementation:

```haskell
ccw :: Tile a -> Tile a
ccw t = cw (cw (cw t))
```

or, in its eta-reduced form:

```haskell
ccw :: Tile a -> Tile a
ccw = cw . cw . cw
```

In general, it's imperative to be very careful in our use of the primitive forms.
We have chosen to implement `ccw` here in terms of the constructor `cw` rather
than the primitive `Cw`. Why is this? It's to ensure that our by-fiat laws get a
chance to simplify the expression. If we instead implemented `ccw` in terms of
`Cw`, it's easy to see how `ccw . ccw` would produce six nested `Cw` nodes ---
which is a state impossible under the implementation of `cw`. In this case, it
probably doesn't matter --- but it can lead to obscure bugs. Thus, it is prudent to
use only a primitive form to implement exactly one constructor, if
at all possible. Doing so will save you many headaches down the line.

To look at a more complicated derivation, let's take `flipV`:

```{.haskell .proof}
âˆ€ (t :: Tile).
  flipV t
= -- .via rotated flipH
  ccw (flipH (cw t))  -- ! 1
= -- .via cw/cw/cw/cw
  ccw (cw (cw (cw (cw (flipH (cw t))))))
= -- .via ccw/cw
  cw (cw (cw (flipH (cw t))))
```

This derivation goes all the way to our primitive forms `cw` and `flipH`, which
is technically the right way to go about things. However, you'll notice that the
line of the proof marked by [1](Ann) is already a perfectly good implementation,
as the remainder of the proof is simply expanding out the implementation of
`ccw`. So long as we approach these derivations in a topologically sorted manner
--- that is, being careful to use only those constructors we have already
implemented --- we can shave off a good deal of the derivation work. Working "all
the way through" a derivation is more important when you haven't enforced any
equations in your implementation by fiat. We can thus give an implementation for
`flipV`:


```haskell
flipV :: Tile a -> Tile a
flipV = ccw . flipH . cw
```

The remainder of the implementations follow in this pattern of using
previously-implemented constructors. Each is an easy, one-step derivation. Let's
start with `above`:

```{.haskell .proof}
  beside t1 t2
= -- .via above
  ccw (above (cw t1) (cw t2))
```

```haskell
beside :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
beside t1 t2 = ccw (above (cw t1) (cw t2))
```

Nice. Again, the implementation follows directly from the laws. This is also the
case for `quad`:

```{.haskell .proof}
  quad t1 t2 t3 t4
= -- .via quad
  above (beside t1 t2) (beside t3 t4)
```

```haskell
quad :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
quad t1 t2 t3 t4 = above (beside t1 t2) (beside t3 t4)
```

and again for `swirl`:

```{.haskell .proof}
  swirl t
= -- .via swirl
  quad t (cw t) (ccw t) (cw (cw t))
```

```haskell
swirl :: Tile a -> Tile a
swirl t = quad t (cw t) (ccw t) $ cw $ cw t
```

In order to give an implementation of `fmap`, we can turn to the applicative
laws:

```{.haskell .proof}
  fmap f t
= -- .via pure/ap
  pure f <*> t
```

which in turn is the delightful (and applicable for every applicative functor)
instance:

```haskell
instance Functor Tile where
  fmap f t = pure f <*> t
```

Finally, `empty` and `behind` turn out to be specific cases of the applicative
operations when generalized to monoids:

```haskell
empty :: Monoid a => Tile a
empty = pure mempty

behind :: Monoid a => Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
behind = flip (liftA2 (<>))
```

Et voila! We automatically have a lawful set of implementations for our initial
encoding. That said, there is still no code that generates an
image --- our observations are still unimplemented. But this is a problem easily
fixed; we need only give an interpreter for the `Tile` syntax tree. Here again,
the laws suggest another implementation, one which operates directly over
two-dimensional lists. Such a thing seems like it would be notoriously slow and
inefficient --- because it will be --- but remember, we're looking only for an
obviously-correct implementation, not a *good* one. That will come later.

We proceed by implementing `rasterize :: Int -> Int -> Tile a -> [[a]]` as a
piece-wise fashion, pattern matching on each data constructor of `Tile`. The
`Pure` case is simplest; it corresponds to a pixel matrix with a constant value
in every cell. Recalling that the result of `rasterize` should be row-major, we
can construct a row with the right width of pixels via `replicate`, and then
replicate that to get the correct height.

```haskell
rasterize w h (Pure a) = replicate h $ replicate w a
```

When designing the algebra, we took great care also to provide a `rasterize'`
observation which is equivalent to `rasterize`, but which is in a form more
amenable to applicative homomorphisms. We can exploit that machinery now in
order to implement `Ap`:

```haskell
rasterize w h (Ap f a) =
  coerce (rasterize' w h f <*> rasterize' w h a)
```

Horizontally flipping an image is also easy; we simply rasterize the underlying
tile and then `reverse` each of its rows:

```haskell
rasterize w h (FlipH t) = fmap reverse $ rasterize w h t
```

Rotation of a tile is a little trickier. Intuition tells us that rotating a
non-square matrix will swap the width and height dimensions, and since we would
like the *result* of `cw` to have the specified dimensions, we must swap the
width and height that we give when rasterizing the inner tile:

```haskell
rasterize w h (Cw t) = rotate2d $ rasterize h w t
  where
    rotate2d = fmap reverse . transpose
```

Our only remaining primitive to interpret is `Above`, which conceptually builds
two half-height tiles and glues them vertically. This definition again maps
directly to an implementation:

```haskell
rasterize w h (Above t1 t2) =
    rasterize w (div h 2) t1 <>
    rasterize w (h - div h 2) t2  -- ! 1
```

At [1](Ann) we use `h - div h 2` as the second width in case the desired height
is odd --- we wouldn't want to drop a pixel accidentally. And just like that, we
have plucked a fully working implementation seemingly out of thin air.

Finally, let's give some instances for `Tile`. It admits obvious `Semigroup` and
`Monoid` instances, simply by lifting an instance from the "pixel" type:

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:SemigroupTile](Snip)

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:MonoidTile](Snip)

Additionally, we'll need a `Show` instance in order for QuickCheck to test our
properties later. This instance unfortunately can't be automatically derived due
to the existential type in `Ap`, but we can write it by hand without much
effort:

```haskell
instance Show a => Show (Tile a) where
  show (Cw t) = "cw (" ++ show t ++ ")"
  show (FlipH t) = "flipH (" ++ show t ++ ")"
  show (Above t1 t2)
    = "above (" ++ show t1 ++ ") (" ++ show t2 ++ ")"
  show (Pure a) = "pure (" ++ show a ++ ")"
  show (Ap _ _) = "ap _ _"  -- ! 1
```

There is no `Show` instance for the existentially quantified type in `Ap`, so we
ignore those two arguments when printing `ap` terms at [1](Ann). This isn't
a perfect solution by any means, but it's practical and gets the job done.


### Generating Tests

In the previous section, we followed our algebra's rules to derive an implementation automatically. The resulting code, while inefficient and naive,
is overwhelmingly simple and is guaranteed to follow our specification. The next
step is to ensure that the specification corresponds with our *intuition,* as
the specification is only useful insofar as it helps us solve problems we are
interested in.

Here again, we can automate a great deal of the tedium involved in checking the
implementation. Most systems are verified using hand-written unit tests: little
checks that the software behaves predictably in particular scenarios. Unit
tests are a good start but suffer from the problem that they are boring and
written by humans. To quote @hughes_experiences_2016:

> Imagine writing a suite of unit tests for software with, say, $n$ different
> features. Probably you will write 3-4 test cases per feature. This is
> perfectly manageable --- itâ€™s a linear amount of work. But, we all know you
> will not find all of your bugs that way, because some bugs can only be
> triggered by a pair of features interacting. Now, you could go on to write
> test cases for every pair of features --- but this is a quadratic amount of
> work, which is much less appealing.

@claessen_quickcheck_2000 present *property tests* as an alternative to unit
tests. Property tests can be thought of as templates for generating unit tests;
by specifying exactly how input and output should be related, a property testing
system can create randomly generated inputs and ensure that the property
always holds. If we generate ten thousand random inputs, and the property holds
for each one, we should be pretty confident that our code is working
as intended. Of course, equality is undecidable in general, but after ten
thousand tests, if the two haven't been shown yet to be unequal, they probably
never will.

Property testing often requires a better understanding of the
software under test, as its authors must be able to describe classes of
correctness, rather than instances of correctness. However, this additional
effort is well rewarded; property tests can be used to stamp out an arbitrary
number of unit tests, driving our confidence of the system asymptotically up to
100%.

But in this section, we will take the automation ladder one rung higher, and
*automatically generate our property tests.* How is such a thing possible? By
giving a reference implementation and a description of the constructors of our
algebra to QuickSpec (@smallbone_quick_2017) --- a theorem searching program ---
it can simply try every possible term, and use property testing to see which
ones are equal.

By treating the matching terms found by QuickSpec as new equations of our
algebra, we are, in essence, discovering property tests that must be true of any
correct implementation. The result? An automatically generated suite of
regression tests.

We will present just enough of QuickCheck and QuickSpec in this section to get
our work done, but each is given a more robust treatment in @sec:quickcheck and
@sec:quickspec, respectively.

Our first step is to write a *generator* for tiles, which is a way of creating
random tiles. Generators run in the `Gen` monad provided by the `QuickCheck`
library, and come with a few primitive actions for picking elements at random.
Generators in `QuickCheck` are usually given via an `Arbitrary` instance,
which defines an `arbitrary` function used to produce random values.

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:ArbitraryTile](Snip)

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:decayArbitrary](Snip)

Every generator has access to an implicit size parameter provided by
the testing engine, which roughly corresponds to how complicated the generated
term should be. At [1](Ann) we get access to the size parameter via the `sized`
function. If the size is less than or equal to one, we simply return a `pure`
tile whose color is itself `arbitrary`. This check ensures that our arbitrary
tile eventually terminates.

At [3](Ann), we use the `frequency` combinator to assign random weights to the
different possibilities of `Tile` constructors. In [4](Ann) we also build an
arbitrary `pure` colored tile, with a weight of 3. At [5](Ann) however, we give
a weight of 9 --- meaning three times more likely --- to the `beside`
constructor, because it results in more complex tiles. Rather than filling in
the parameters of `beside` with `arbitrary` tiles directly, we instead use the
`decayArbitrary 2` combinator, which asks for a tile that is half as complicated
as the one we are being asked to generate. In this way, we are "splitting our
complexity budget" between the two sub-tiles. Due to polymorphism, the
call to `arbitrary` at [5](Ann) creates a `Tile a`, but at [4](Ann)
it creates just a bare `a`.

Notably missing from the definition of `arbitrary` are the `behind` and `empty`
constructors. This is a technical limitation; those constructors
require `a` to be a monoid, but nothing else in the algebra does. If we included
them in the list, we'd only generate tiles of monoids, which is
somewhat annoying for testing purposes. We console ourselves with the
understanding that `empty` and `behind` are specializations of `pure` and
`(<*>)` respectively, both of which get generated by this instance. In a real
codebase, you'd probably want to do some trickery to allow both instances to
exist, but such a thing is out of this book's scope.

The remainder of the instance carries on in this way, listing the constructors
with relative weights, and building them out of `arbitrary` smaller pieces.
There is nothing of real interest here; every generator you write should have
the same shape, containing:

1. a check of the size parameter, terminating in a simple constructor if
   required.
2. a list of every constructor of the algebra, each lifted into the `Gen`
   monad, with arbitrary children.

It's **extremely important** that your generator use the algebra's constructors,
and not the data constructors (that is, it should use `cw` instead of `Cw`.)
Recall that our algebraic constructors possibly contain pattern matching that
implements by-fiat laws; thus, building terms out of the data constructors
directly is likely to break your invariants.

As it happens, this `Arbitrary` instance (and one for `Color`, elided here) is
all that's required for us to generate random tiles --- some samples of which
are given in [@fig:random1;@fig:random2;@fig:random3].

```{#fig:random1 design=code/Tiles/Efficient.hs label="Random Tile 1"}
unsafePerformIO $ generate arbitrary
```
```{#fig:random2 design=code/Tiles/Efficient.hs label="Random Tile 2"}
unsafePerformIO $ generate arbitrary
```
```{#fig:random3 design=code/Tiles/Efficient.hs label="Random Tile 3"}
unsafePerformIO $ generate arbitrary
```

Our next course of action is to teach the testing program about what equality
means. Recall that we are explicitly not using whatever notion of equality
Haskell gives us, instead choosing to reason via `law:obs eq`, reproduced here:

```{.haskell law="obs eq"}
âˆ€ (t1 :: Tile) (t2 :: Tile).
  (âˆ€ (w :: Int) (h :: Int).
    rasterize w h t1 == rasterize w h t2) => t1 = t2
```

This law states that two tiles `t1` and `t2` are equal *if and only if* they
rasterize to the same pixels for every imaginable width and height. Regardless
of the actual memory layout for our tiles, this is the metric by which we'd like
to consider two tiles equal. This notion can be encoded by giving an instance of
the `Observe` typeclass from the `quickspec` library.

`Observe` allows us to describe observational equality between terms ---
possibly requiring quantified arguments. As an interface, it requires us to fill
in one function, `observe`, which has a parameter for the quantified arguments,
and another for the term we'd like to observe. These arguments are
generated randomly via the property testing `Arbitrary` machinery, and two
terms require observed equality for every input thrown at them.

We'd like to write an instance that looks like this:

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:BadObserveTile](Snip)

This says that given two small integers ([1](Ann)) corresponding to the width
and height, we can observe a `Tile a` value ([3](Ann)) as a `[[a]]` ([2](Ann)).
We implement the `observe` function as `rasterize` at [4](Ann), ensuring that
the width and height are both at least one.

While this instance is what we want conceptually, it doesn't work as written.
The issue is that pesky universally quantified type `a`; we have no guarantees
that it can be observed. The fix is a little mind-bending: we must
introduce an `Observe` constraint for `a`, and observe our matrix of pixels in
terms of the observation on `a`. The working instance is listed below, but it's
important to keep in mind that this is an implementation detail, not a moral
one.

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:ObserveTile](Snip)

Our new `Observe` instance gives us access to the `(=~=)` operator, which
creates a property test showing observational equality between two terms. For
example, we can now test `law:cw/cw/cw/cw` experimentally:

```{ghci=code/Tiles/Initial.hs}
quickCheck $ cw @Bool . cw . cw . cw =~= id
```

We need to specify `@Bool` to tell Haskell which sort of tiles to generate ---
left to its own devices it will pick the single-valued type `()` which is always
equal to itself, and thus particularly unhelpful for testing equality. The
`quickCheck` function then generated 100 different random tiles and checked to
see that each was observationally equal to rotating the tile four times
clockwise. In essence, it created one hundred unique unit tests, and our
implementation passed each!

Compare the amount of code we wrote in this section to the amount of code we
would have needed to write to create one hundred unit tests. When you
take into account that the number one hundred is arbitrary and could just as
easily have been ten thousand (use `quickCheckWith stdArgs {maxSuccess = 10000}`
instead), perhaps the power of this approach becomes more apparent to you.

More amazingly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. While we certainly could go
and write property tests for every law we discovered in @sec:tiles, it feels
like a wasted effort. After all, every one should pass, since
our implementation is derived from those same laws. Of course, just
because they *should* pass doesn't mean they *will,* and we must still exercise
prudence. But rather than write these tests ourselves, let's get the computer to
do it for us.

Here is where the `quickspec` library comes in. We need only to write a
*signature* of our algebra, describing what constructors and types are
available, and it will do the rest. By enumerating every possible well-typed
expression up to a maximum size and comparing them observationally to one
another, QuickSpec will find *every law* that holds for our implementation. We
can then look over the results, ensuring ours are present. If everything looks
good, QuickSpec has an option which emits valid Haskell property tests for each.

Several combinators exist for building QuickSpec signatures, with the most
important of them being `con :: String -> a -> Sig`. This signature is used to describing
constructors. I like to list my constructors together in one big signature:

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:sig_cons](Snip)

At [1](Ann), we use the `@A` notation to let QuickSpec know that the `cw`
function is polymorphic in its argument. The exact details aren't important
right now but are described thoroughly in @sec:quickspec. Additionally, at
[2](Ann), we use the `liftC @(Monoid A)` combinator to inform QuickSpec that
`behind` is only available if there is a `Monoid` instance available. Don't
worry; if you get it wrong, the compiler will yell at you. Unfortunately, the
path forward in such cases isn't always as straightforward as might be desired.

Additionally, there are some latent constructors we should teach QuickSpec
about. Although our algebra doesn't deal *directly* with monoids, they are
present "in the background" --- for example, with `empty` and `behind`. The
monoid operations aren't directly applicable to our algebra, but we'd like to
know about any "interesting" laws mentioning them. By using the `background`
signature, we can "hide" constructors:

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:sig_bg](Snip)

By wrapping the contents of `sig_bg` inside `background`, it means QuickSpec
will still tell us about monoidal laws for our types --- so long as they're not
true for *all* monoids!

Finally, we must teach QuickSpec about the relevant types in our algebra:

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:sig_types](Snip)

We use the `mono` combinator at [1](Ann) to inform QuickSpec of a type that can use
everyday Haskell equality. Similarly, the `monoObserve` combinator at [2](Ann)
is used for types that require *observational* equality. At [3](Ann),
`instanceOf` is used to declare the presence of a `Monoid` instance. The `vars`
combinator gives hints for how to name variables of the specified
type, like at [4](Ann). Finally, at [5](Ann), we ask QuickSpec to instantiate
all polymorphic type variables at `[Word8]`.

Why `[Word8]`? Because I've coyly been avoiding discussing colors, as getting
them right is tricky and not particularly enlightening. As such, we need *some*
monoid, and any monoid would do. But `Word8` has some desirable properties:
256 values is small enough that we can expect any particular number to be hit,
but large enough that the collisions should be relatively rare. Hitting every
value (being *surjective*) is vital to ensure there are no edge cases,
but having a high number of collisions might accidentally show equalities where
there are none. As an extreme example of this last case, imagine what would
happen if we used a type that had only one value.

So that explains why we use `Word8`. By why a list? Simply to introduce
a monoid.

Signatures themselves form a monoid, so we can build an aggregate signature out
of these smaller pieces:

[code/Tiles/Initial.hs:sig](Snip)

We can now ask QuickSpec to discover all of
the laws of our algebra. The following command might take upwards of ten
minutes to complete, so now would be a good time for a coffee break. Remember,
the goal is not yet to be fast; we are satisfied temporarily with mere
correctness.

Without further ado:

```{#term_laws quickspec=code/Tiles/Initial.hs}
quickSpec sig
```

The laws presented here are the ones which QuickSpec *couldn't falsify.* It's
uncomputable in general to determine if two computer programs are equivalent,
but we expect programs that are significantly different to diverge quickly. Thus
QuickSpec has pruned any equations that diverged in a finite number of tests,
and these are the ones that remain. It's possible that throwing more CPU at them
might find a counterexample, but we're still in the discovery phase right now,
and we can manually test any dubious properties by hand.

As you can see, QuickSpec has done a top-notch job, and found nearly fifty
different properties that hold for our algebra. While many of them are old
friends that we discovered in @sec:tiles, many others are new to us --- though
obvious in retrospect. For example, we hadn't spotted the vast swathe of monoid
homomorphisms like laws [CiteLaw:term_laws](pure x <> pure y = pure (x <> y)),
[CiteLaw:term_laws](ccw t <> ccw t2 = ccw (t <> t2)),
[CiteLaw:term_laws](flipH t <> flipH t2 = flipH (t <> t2)),
[CiteLaw:term_laws](flipV t <> flipV t2 = flipV (t <> t2)) and
[CiteLaw:term_laws](swirl  t <> swirl t2 = swirl (t <> t2)). Curiously
missing from this list is a monoid homomorphism for `cw` --- does such a thing
not hold? QuickSpec tries to be clever and hide laws which can be derived from
others, so its absence from this list might not be evidence of a bug. We can
find out by writing a quick property test:

```{ghci=code/Tiles/Initial.hs}
quickCheck $ \t1 t2 -> cw @[Word8] t1 <> cw t2 =~= cw (t1 <> t2)
```

Looks good. I'm not sure why QuickSpec doesn't mention this law, which is a good
reminder that we haven't entirely automated away the engineer's job! Besides, this approach of using a property test to verify a hypothesis about
our codebase is a powerful tool. Property tests need not necessarily be *tests*
per se; we can also use them in a scientific context to learn things!

In this case, we got lucky. Often QuickSpec will emit what appear to be
crazy, nonsensical laws. More often than not, such behavior is indicative of
either a faulty generator or a buggy implementation. @Sec:quickspec discusses these
issues and their fixes in more detail.

Now that we are happy with our laws, we can *freeze the semantics* of our
implementation, immortalizing its equations in executable property
tests. Remember that QuickCheck and QuickSpec are inherently stochastic, working
by Monte Carlo methods to approximate answers to uncomputable questions. This is
an important thing to keep in mind when generating property tests --- it would
be exceedingly disorienting if QuickSpec got lucky with all of its random numbers
and emitted an invalid law. We'd be tearing our hair out trying to fix a "bug"
that never existed in the first place! This imagery is a stark reminder to set
an exceptionally high bar of confidence for QuickSpec when generating tests.

By setting the `withMaxTests` signature to a big number (I like 1,000,000), we
can ask QuickSpec for extra diligence when testing its laws. We can also set
`withMaxTestSize` to increase the complexity of the generated arguments it
tests. Both of these options have the potential to increase dramatically
QuickSpec's running time, so I like to set them to big numbers and then go home
for the day; if anyone complains, tell them you'll have thousands of unit tests
written for them by tomorrow.

To illustrate this functionality in QuickSpec, I will also use the
`withMaxTermSize` signature[^not-max-test] to significantly reduce the size of
expressions that QuickSpec generates; there is not much value in reading through
the code for automatically generated property tests. When doing this for real,
you should use a value somewhere between 7 and 9.

[^not-max-test]: Note that `withMaxTermSize` is the max *term* size, not the
  *test* size. QuickSpec also provides a `withMaxTestSize` parameter which
  sets the desired complexity of the generated test examples. It's an easy
  to misread one as the other, so pay close attention when dealing with them ---
  especially because their good values differ by an order of magnitude!

```{quickspec=code/Tiles/Initial.hs replace="1000=1000000"}
quickSpec $ sig <> withPrintStyle ForQuickCheck <> withMaxTests 1000 <> withMaxTestSize 20 <> withMaxTermSize 2
```

The resulting `quickspec_laws` can be pasted into a test module, and executed
via:

```haskell
runTests :: IO ()
runTests
  = traverse_
      (quickCheck . uncurry counterexample)
      quickspec_laws
```

As an added precaution, it's good form to ensure that your new tests are green
before continuing.

```haskell
> runTests
```

Looks good!

To reiterate, these tests we've generated correspond to all the observable
semantics of our implementation. Because our implementation is extremely simple
and derived directly from the design work we did, it is exceedingly likely
correct. In aggregate, these two facts mean that any *other*
implementation which passes the tests must also be correct. We will turn our
attention to a better implementation in the next section.


### An Efficient Implementation

With our semantics now perfected and nailed down, we have successfully described
*what* we're trying to build. And now for the fun part of the
problem --- actually making it! Of course, our initial encoding is indeed an
implementation, and many times that's good enough. Not every issue needs a
fast, creative solution. The abstraction boundary we've set up --- our public
interface, its semantics and the regression tests witnessing those semantics ---
is completely airtight. We can thus swap out the implementation at any point in
time, and our users would be none the wiser, except perhaps in that their
programs' performance improved.

This is a very different state of affairs than what we usually see in software
engineering. Because the library which perfectly hides its implementation is
very rare indeed, implementation details are often accidentally interwoven with
semantics. The maintenance programmer is unable to make sweeping architectural
changes, as it would be a breaking change. As a result, programmers are taught
from their early education to be hyper-aware of their
programs' performance; they probably won't get a chance to improve the asymptotics later on.

Our abstraction barrier makes these performance concerns non-issues. We can do
something stupid at first, and swap it out wholesale later if it turns out to be
too slow. Maybe our component will need to be changed later, but because the new
implementation must be indistinguishable from the last, this happens to be an
amortized constant amount of work. Call sites don't need to be updated, and
there is a good chance that your first implementation is sufficient anyway.

Let's turn these concerns aside and assume that improving
our tile library's performance is time well spent. Can Algebra-Driven Design help us? In
general, yes, but no longer can it do *all* of the work for us. Instead, the
value of Algebra-Driven Design becomes helping to ask the right questions, and
allowing our human intuition to take the reins.

The messiest part by far of our design are the laws around `rasterize`. Recall
that our rule of thumb is "messy things are where the problems lie", so this
seems like a good place to focus our attention. Each `rasterize` law
performs some extremely list-specific operations, many of which are hard to
motivate other than "they seem to work."

Of particular concern is the asymmetry between the rows and columns. While our
algebra treats the horizontal and vertical directions completely equivalently,
our implementation does not. Implementing a matrix as a list-of-lists requires
us to choose which list means what. We arbitrarily chose a
row-major ordering, but in making that choice, have resigned `law:rasterize/beside`
to look significantly different than `law:rasterize/above`. Something is fishy
here. It's not wrong per se, merely inelegant.

But the real smoking gun in our specification of `rasterize` is in the
applicative homomorphism `law:rasterize/ap`. To be more specific, that
`law:rasterize/pure` *isn't also* an applicative homomorphism. Let's see why
not, and then investigate what that means.

We chose the `ZipList` applicative for our `rasterize'` function because it
combines two lists element-wise, rather than taking the usual Cartesian-product
applicative instance for lists. @Sec:applicative discusses the difference
between these two applicatives in more detail, and readers unfamiliar with zip
lists are encouraged to read that section before continuing here.

Even though `law:rasterize/ap` is an applicative morphism, its partner
`law:rasterize/pure` isn't.  This makes no sense semantically; an applicative is
made up of both `(<*>)` and `pure`; they don't come individually wrapped. The
two are defined relative to one another, and if we are missing one of these
homomorphisms while the other holds, it is merely by accident. Which raises the
question: is ours only by accident?

Resoundingly, the answer is no! When you look at `law:rasterize/pure`, morally,
it is attempting to to fill all of space with a single value. This fact is
hindered by our choice of trying to generate finite, nested lists.

All of this analysis is characteristic of our having *used the wrong
observation.* Whatever this thing we're trying to build is, it's too specific.
That is to say, `rasterize` might be the right thing to *implement,* but it is
the wrong thing to *reason about.* Instead, we should be looking for some other
observation, one from which we can define `rasterize` itself.

Our missing `law:rasterize/pure` homomorphism is the clue we need. Whatever this
observation is, it should fill infinite space, zip elements together pairwise,
and as a bonus, treat the horizontal and vertical directions symmetrically.
Being familiar with the standard canon of algebraic structures comes in handy
here, because the algebra of functions themselves has the exact properties we're
looking for!

Imagine an alternative universe in which we implemented `Tile` as:

```haskell
type Tile a = Point -> a
```

For our purposes, we will say that a `Point` is defined as:

```haskell
type Point = (Double, Double)
```

although you can imagine what sorts of exciting things might happen if we
were to play around with this --- perhaps adding extra dimensions, or
parameterizing the entire type. We will not further explore this line of inquiry
, but the curious reader is encouraged to do so.

We can write out the applicative instance for functions, just to familiarize
ourselves and to get some intuition behind why this is the instance we're
looking for. First, `pure`:

```haskell
pure :: a -> (Point -> a)
pure a = \_ -> a  -- ! 1
```

The implementation of `pure` for functions takes the value `a` that we'd like,
and then creates a function which ignores its argument and always gives back
`a`. This is analogous to the zip list equivalent, which created an infinitely
long list of the same value. Here instead, we are creating a function that
"fills" its entire domain with the same value. Let's now look at `(<*>)`:

```haskell
(<*>)
    :: (Point -> (a -> b))
    -> (Point -> a)
    -> (Point -> b)
ff <*> fa = \p -> (ff p) (fa p)
```

Here we have two functions, the first being a function from a `Point` *to
another function* --- this time from `a` to `b`. Our other function is one from
`Point` to `a`. Our goal is to produce a function from points to `b`! The
solution is simple: we apply the `Point` to both of our functions, resulting in
an `a -> b` and an `a`. All that's left is to apply them.

The result of this odd `(<*>)` for functions is similar to zip
lists. In essence, it combines a function at a given point in space with a
value at the same point in a different space. This, too, is performed
"element-wise."


Exercise

:  Prove that `law:ap/pure/id` is satisfied by the definitions of `pure` and `(<*>)`
   given here.


Let's assume that our *one true observation,* that is to say, the *denotation*
of a `Tile` is given by `sample`:

```haskell
sample :: Point -> Tile a -> a
```

This observation, unlike `rasterize`, is *continuous* in its domain, and allows
for infinitely[^approximate-infinity] sized tiles. Of course, at some point we
still need to be able to rasterize it to be viewed on a screen, but often
working with continuous functions is much more elegant than their discrete
counterparts.

[^approximate-infinity]: Or at least, as many distinct numbers that we can
  represent in a `Double`.

We will designate by convention the area `(-1, -1)` and `(1, 1)` to be the
surface of the `Tile` that will be rasterized. While a tile might be infinite,
this is the only area that we will pay attention to, and for which we will care
about the semantics. Let's re-specify our algebraic constructors in terms of
`sample`, and see what is simplified. To flip a tile, we now negate the
x-coordinate that is being sampled:

```{.haskell law="sample/flipH"}
âˆ€ (t :: Tile a) (x :: Double) (y :: Double).
  sample (x, y) (flipH t) =
    sample (negate x, y) t
```

The `flipV` is completely analogous:

```{.haskell law="sample/flipV"}
âˆ€ (t :: Tile a) (x :: Double) (y :: Double).
  sample (x, y) (flipV t) =
    sample (x, negate y) t
```

This is already a marked improvement over `law:rasterize/flipH` and
`law:rasterize/flipV`, which required asymmetric machinery to target which list
was supposed to be reversed. By contrast, `law:sample/flipH` and
`law:sample/flipV` are exact counterparts.

If we decide (by convention) that a negative x-coordinate corresponds to the
left, and a negative y-coordinate to up, then `cw` can also be specified
elegantly:

```{.haskell law="sample/cw"}
âˆ€ (t :: Tile a) (x :: Double) (y :: Double).
  sample (x, y) (cw t) =
    sample (y, negate x) t
```

Without the challenging `transpose` machinery that we saw in `law:sample/cw`, we
can specify `ccw` directly, without needing to relegate to `law:ccw`:

```{.haskell law="sample/ccw"}
âˆ€ (t :: Tile a) (x :: Double) (y :: Double).
  sample (x, y) (ccw t) =
    sample (negate y, x) t
```

Again, this pair of laws is elegant, symmetric, and clearly shows why `cw . ccw
= id` must be true.


We can think of `beside` as a spatial transformation from the coordinate space
of `both c1 c2` (the "source") into the coordinate spaces of `c1` and `c2` (the
"destinations.") The cut-off between the two happens tiles at $x = 0$, therefore for
$x < 0$ we should choose `c1` and for $0 \leq x$ choose `c2`. Due to the
contravariance of spatial transformations, this operation's mathematics are rather hard to visualize mentally. @Fig:beside-impl shows the `c1` case and should help.

We first need to align these spaces' centers by adding 0.5 to the sampled
$x$ coordinate in the source. Because the $y$ coordinate isn't affected by
`beside`, the point $(-0.5, 0)$ in the source should correspond
with $(0, 0)$ in the `c1` destination. Since the source is sampled at half the
entire space's width, it thus has width 1, but the destination has width 2.
Therefore we can map `c1` in the source to the `c1` destination through the
following transformation:

$$
f(x, y) = ((x + 0.5) * 2, y)
$$

The `c2` case is identical, except that we need to subtract `0.5` instead of
adding it. This analysis leads to two `sample/beside` laws:

![Transformation from the coordinate space of `beside c1 c2` to the coordinate space of `c1`.](images/transform-space2.png){#fig:beside-impl}


```{.haskell law="sample/beside (left)"}
âˆ€ (t1 :: Tile a) (t2 :: Tile a) (x :: Double)
      (y :: Double).
  x < 0 =>
    sample (x, y) (beside t1 t2) =
      sample ((x + 0.5) * 2, y) t1
```

and

```{.haskell law="sample/beside (right)"}
âˆ€ (t1 :: Tile a) (t2 :: Tile a) (x :: Double)
      (y :: Double).
  x >= 0 =>
    sample (x, y) (beside t1 t2) =
      sample ((x - 0.5) * 2, y) t2
```

We choose `0 <= x` as the condition for `law:sample/beside (right)` to mirror
our decision in `law:rasterize/beside` that the right-side should "pick up" the
middle pixel.

As you would expect, the laws for `above` are again symmetrical and analogous.


Exercise

:  Give `law:sample/above (top)` and `law:sample/above (bottom)`.


Finally, we can show as we intentionally designed that `sample` has a true
applicative morphism:

```{.haskell law="sample/pure"}
âˆ€ (a :: a) (x :: Double) (y :: Double).
  sample (x, y) (pure a) = pure a
```

and:

```{.haskell law="sample/ap"}
âˆ€ (tf :: Tile (a -> b)) (ta :: Tile a) (x :: Double)
      (y :: Double).
  sample (x, y) (tf <*> ta) =
    sample (x, y) tf <*> sample (x, y) ta
```

Very elegant.

This discovery of simpler semantics suggests an alternative implementation for
tiles: we can represent them in this function form directly, and rely on Haskell
to "fuse" the functions together --- optimizing any statically-known tiles at
compile time. Such an optimization will not work in all languages, so
domain expertise is required. Nevertheless, in this case, we have found an
optimization --- at the very least, we won't need to allocate intermediary
linked lists!

Rather than introducing `sample` as an implementation detail in our program, we
can use the `sample` laws *directly.* Because all of our observations can be
derived from `sample`, we conclude that `sample` *is* the abstraction. By
manipulating the type of `sample` so that its `Tile a` argument is front, we can
find an equivalent formulation that is more amenable for defining a type.

```{.haskell .proof}
  Point -> Tile a -> a
=  -- .via flip
  Tile a -> Point -> a
=  -- .via defn of Point
  Tile a -> (Double, Double) -> a
=  -- .via curry
  Tile a -> Double -> Double -> a
```

With our `Tile a` parameter in the first position, it's clearer to see that the
*implementation* of a `Tile` is a function which takes it to a function `Double
-> Double -> a`. That is:

```haskell
sample :: Tile a -> (Double -> Double -> a)
```

which we can encode via a `newtype`:


[code/Tiles/Efficient.hs:Tile](Snip)

Just to confirm that we haven't done any tricks here, we can investigate the
type of `sample`:

```{ghci=code/Tiles/Efficient.hs}
:t sample
```

As expected! This transformation takes some time to get used to, but is always
applicable and very powerful. To reiterate, the steps are:

1. Find the *denotation,* that is, the elegant, homomorphic observation from
   which all other observations can be derived. The denotation will always be a
   function.
2. Manipulate the type of that observation, so the algebra's type comes as the
   first parameter in the function.
3. Drop this first parameter from the type of the denotation.
4. Implement the algebra as the remaining type of the denotation.

With `Tile` defined *as* the denotation, we can now use the `sample` laws as
*direct implementations* for every constructor in the algebra. For example, we
can implement `flipV` as:

```haskell
flipV :: Tile a -> Tile a
flipV t = Tile $ \x y -> sample t x (negate y)
```

and `beside` as:

```haskell
beside :: Tile a -> Tile a -> Tile a
beside t1 t2 = Tile $ \x y ->
  if x < 0
    then sample t1 ((x + 0.5) * 2) y
    else sample t2 ((x - 0.5) * 2) y
```


Exercise

:  Implement the remaining constructors of our algebra.


After implementing each constructor, we are left only to write `rasterize`.  But
such a thing is trivial. We need only divide up the tile's renderable area into
the correct number of rows and columns, sampling each:

[code/Tiles/Efficient.hs:rasterize](Snip)

The changes in implementation here are straightforward if a little finicky.
A few bugs might likely make it in during the process, but not to
fear: our generated regression tests are guaranteed to catch any observable
differences between our new implementation and our last. Finally, we are left
with a fast, general implementation of functional geometry and needed to do
very little work other than thinking to make it happen.
